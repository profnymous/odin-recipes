    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancake" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pancake</a>, also known as a hotcake, griddlecake, or flapjack, is a flat type of batter bread like cake, often thin and round, prepared from a starch-based batter that may contain eggs, milk, and butter, and then cooked on a hot surface such as a griddle or frying pan. Archaeological evidence suggests that pancakes were probably eaten in prehistoric societies.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Leaveners</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Buttermilk</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Mix the dry ingredients:</strong> Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.</li>
            <li><strong>Mix the wet ingredients:</strong> Beat the buttermilk, milk, eggs, and melted butter together in a separate bowl. Do not combine the wet and dry ingredients until right before you cook the pancakes.</li>
            <li><strong>Make the pancakes:</strong> Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix with a wooden spoon or fork until the mixtures are just-blended. Scoop the batter onto a hot, oiled griddle and cook until the pancake is bubbly on the top. Flip with a spatula and cook until both sides are brown.</li>
        </ol>
