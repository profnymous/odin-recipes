# 🧑‍🍳 Odin Recipes

This is my first project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) foundations course.  
The goal of this project is to build a basic recipe website using **only HTML**.

---

## 🥣 What I’ll Learn

By completing this project, I’ll practice and demonstrate:

- Using **Git** and **GitHub** for version control  
- Writing semantic **HTML**  
- Creating and linking multiple pages  
- Structuring a simple website  
- Writing clear commit messages and organizing files properly

---

## 📁 Project Structure

The website will include:

- A main `index.html` page listing all recipes  
- Individual HTML pages for each recipe (e.g., `lasagna.html`, `pizza.html`, etc.)

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

Later, I’ll add **CSS** for styling and possibly use **JavaScript** to make the site interactive as I progress through The Odin Project curriculum.
